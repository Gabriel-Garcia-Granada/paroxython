Over the years, you have accumulated dozens of programs, some suitable for beginners, others requiring more advanced knowledge.

The definition of a taxonomy is, at least partly, a matter of pedagogical choices. You are encouraged to duplicate the default taxonomy, and replace or delete those taxa that do not fit your course purpose or logic.
