Allen's interval algebra (1983) defines 13 basic operators which capture all possible relations between two temporal intervals.

| \(x\) &nbsp; `......#####.........` &nbsp; | |
|-----|------|
| \(y\) &nbsp; `......#####.........` &nbsp; | &nbsp; \(x\) is **equal** to \(y\)
| \(y\) &nbsp; `.............#####..` &nbsp; | &nbsp; \(x\) takes place **before** \(y\)
| \(y\) &nbsp; `...........#####....` &nbsp; | &nbsp; \(x\) **meets** \(y\)
| \(y\) &nbsp; `.........#####......` &nbsp; | &nbsp; \(x\) **overlaps** with \(y\)
| \(y\) &nbsp; `......########......` &nbsp; | &nbsp; \(x\) **starts** \(y\)
| \(y\) &nbsp; `....##########......` &nbsp; | &nbsp; \(x\) **during** \(y\)
| \(y\) &nbsp; `...#########........` &nbsp; | &nbsp; \(x\) **finishes** \(y\)
