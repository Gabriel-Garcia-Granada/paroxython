# About

## What's in a name?

Far from being an arbitrary label, “Paroxython” has been scientifically formulated by an independent laboratory to possess the following properties:

1. It features both “Python” and “taxon”.
2. “Paroxytone” denotes a word accented or stressed on the penult[^paroxytone].
3. This translates as “paroxyton” in my mother tongue, and I fart in your general direction.

[^paroxytone]:
    “paroxytone,” Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/paroxytone. Accessed 8/7/2020.
